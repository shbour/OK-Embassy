We are the face of OKCash, Canadian community leader

OUR MISSION
Helping individuals to understand Cryptocurrency and how it changes the world.
Bring awarness about OKCash and how quick and easy it is to use, while encouraging the use of Bitcoin.
OKCash is a new Cryptocurrency that got released in November 2014. Since the start, OK has shown a unique interest in the end user and tried to make the coin accessible and easy to use for the community.

OK complements BTC, with its speed and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system which makes it a day to day currency and also works as an earning system.


###We are the nerds, the misfits, the rebels, the trouble makers, the crazy ones enough to believe we can do so with our passion. Decentralize everything and Empower Everyone.

####- Oktoshi, creator of OKCash and ROKOS
